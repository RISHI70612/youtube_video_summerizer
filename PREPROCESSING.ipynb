      "     hi welcome to another episode of Cold     Fusion     in cold Fusion's early days back in the     early to mid-2010s a lot of Android     phones would make their way onto the     channel one very common feature among     these phones was use a replaceable     batteries at the time carrying a spare     battery in your pocket wasn't that     unusual of an occurrent but have you     ever wondered what happened to that     nowadays thanks to industry-wide design     changes glass glue and metals have     become the industry standard for     materials because of this easily     replaceable batteries are no longer     possible this just been the way things     have been for the better part of a     decade but things are about to change in     a sweeping new law by the European     Parliament replaceable battery products     will be forced back into fashion the law     will have an effect on phones tablets     and laptops not just in Europe but     worldwide in this episode we'll take a     quick look     we were watching cool Fusion TV     [Music]     in June of 2023 the European Parliament     voted 587 to 9 in a bid to force all     consumer devices to have easily     replaceable batteries easily replaceable     means that the battery changing process     should require no special tools this     means manufacturers can no longer use     adhesives the direct quote from the EU     is that battery replacement should     require quote no tool or set of tools     that is supplied with the product or     spare part or basic tools the process     for replacement shall be able to be     carried out by a Layman     almost all smartphones today are     designed like a glass sandwich this was     the design that was settled upon as the     smartphone market matured the glass     sandwich method of construction is Sleek     and thin but relies on an extensive use     of adhesives this law would mean that     the very fundamentals of how companies     design phones will need to change unless     companies figure out a new way to build     the same phones without adhesives     manufacturers from Apple to Google to     Samsung will be affected     foldable phones will face a huge     challenge when trying to comply with     these laws so we'll have to wait and see     on that front     so how does the law in the EU possibly     affect the rest of the world well it's     likely that phone manufacturers aren't     going to design a specific phone for the     EU     reason being it's expensive so it's     going to eat into their profit     Apple for example is unlikely to design     a European iPhone with a replaceable     battery and another iPhone with a sealed     battery for other regions this EU lore     will have a Rippling consequence across     the world     but it goes further the law also affects     tablets laptops EVS e-bikes and     basically anything with a rechargeable     battery in July of 2023 the law was     approved by the European Council and     will come into effect in 2027. this     gives over three years for manufacturers     to get their act together this will be     an especially big change for Apple who     have never featured removable batteries     since the very first iPhone Samsung     stopped featuring removable batteries on     their flagships back in 2014. so many     people think that waterproofing and dust     proofing will be much harder to achieve     but right to repair Advocate Lewis     Rossman argues some good points so I am     old enough to remember when this was not     a repair but maintenance and I'm also     old enough to remember that Society     seems to have this Collective Amnesia     regarding water resistance there was an     article going over this where it said     that one needs to be aware that     incorporating easily removable bags will     mean these handsets will lose water     resistance unless a well thought out     design is undertaken again selective     amnesia for the phases like the Samsung     S5 which is IP67 or the Sony xb10 which     is ip68 this device is ip68 with a user     removable battery     some others argue that removable     batteries will make smartphones bulky     and less premium but the LG G5 proved     that it was possible to make a phone     thin premium and with a removable     battery right to repair campaigns     coordinator Christina gnapi calls the     ruling quote a big success for right to     repair     [Music]     for those of you unfamiliar right to     repair is a movement that calls for     consumer goods to be easily repairable     we've all seen the trend when your TV or     phone is broken it's more common for     people to just buy a new one instead of     repairing it this is due to the     components becoming more complex and     integrated over time but some companies     are straight up anti-consumer in this     context apple is the biggest culprit if     you own a later model iPhone and the     screen breaks and you go to replace it     with a perfectly good screen from the     same model Apple will disable some     features and warn you that it's not     genuine     the same goes for replacing the battery     or camera and even if they are genuine     parts but don't have the same serial     number things don't work as they should     this wasn't the case for older Apple     products it's an effort to make their     users send their devices only to Apple     so an exorbitant fee can be extracted     from consumers further to this apple     does not supply diagnostic software and     they've even raided repair shops for     having a large stock of genuine repair     parts     let's say that in your MacBook you have     a broken display Flex cable Apple     intentionally connects the display Flex     Cable in such a way that you can't just     replace the cable you have to replace     the entire display and this can cost     over 700 or a wire to it if we're     looking at a flex cable a flex cable     that is less than 50 cents I'm telling     people I'm telling technicians that get     paid 30 to 50 an hour spend an hour     trying to fix this Flex cable that costs     50 cents because we're not allowed to     replace it so if the pads are missing we     have to start scraping away with a     dental pick and hope that we can solder     a little jumper wire onto a flex cable     to reattach it to a chip that was     corroded that we then have to file away     at to get to the metal because I can't     put a new 50 Cent Hall sensor on that     person's MacBook because if I do it     won't work I understand the argument for     Apple wanting safer repairs but should     this mean that even a qualified external     repair technician should be blocked from     helping people with their damaged     devices     of course Apple isn't the only company     that does this but for the context of     this story they're the most relevant     [Music]     so what's the intention of this law     the new law isn't for consumers as much     as it is to protect the environment     today when a phone's battery dwindles     after a few years it's much easier for     the common user to just buy a new one     instead of repairing it over 50 million     annual tons of E-Waste is generated this     way the European Parliament is making     sure that the environmental impacts of     batteries is considered they're aiming     to create a circular economy for     batteries     this means that in a product life cycle     as little as possible of the battery's     raw materials should be wasted     here are some rules covered by the law     pertaining to replaceable batteries     phone manufacturers will need to collect     63 of portable batteries that would     normally go into landfill by the end of     2027. lithium recovery from waste     batteries will need to be at 50 percent     by 2027 and EV batteries will need to be     made of certain percentages of     recyclable content initially 16 Cobalt     85 lead 6 lithium and six percent nickel     all batteries should have a recycling     efficiency Target of 50 by 2025.     this all sounds fine but the first point     seems difficult getting consumers to     responsibly give their older phone     batteries back to the manufacturer will     be tricky to enforce we'll have to see     [Music]     so it's unlikely that there's going to     be any changes in the next few months to     a year but after this Smartphone makers     will have to start gearing up for     compliance with a new law we'll start to     see the results of these efforts over     the next few years I did say earlier     that it's unlikely that manufacturers     will Design two different phones an     iPhone for Europe and another for the     rest of the world but anything is     possible really     it's also going to be fascinating to see     what happens to laptops e-bikes and EVS     regardless things are going to be shaken     up in the next few years and an     interesting question that I post to you     is do you think that the phasing out of     user replaceable batteries was just the     natural progression of design as     dictated by consumer demand or are these     changes motivated by profit resulting in     anti-consumer products let me know what     you think in the comments section below     if you want to see another cold fusion     episode on battery recycling I'll link     that below oh and the third and final     episode of my AI series with the     Australian Broadcasting Corporation will     be live soon     I'll leave a link for that in the     description below cheers guys have a     good one     [Music]     all right     all right
